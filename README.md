This repository contains a [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) template for my personal website ([djdn.de](https://djdn.de)).
It's based on [v4](https://getkirby.com/releases/4.0) of that great flat-file CMS and can be seen as a work in progress project.

Several free and open source resouces are used to build this template. A list of them can be [found on my site](https://djdn.de/kolophon).

Cheers. :)
